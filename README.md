# Legal Marketplace Platform (Laravel)

## Overview

The **Legal Marketplace Platform** is a Laravel-based web application designed to connect two types of users: **Legal Workers** (e.g., Advocates, Arbitrators, Mediators) and **Users/Clients** (people seeking legal services). This platform helps users find legal professionals based on their role, specialization, and location. Users can request legal services, and legal workers can manage their requests efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Authentication**: Separate user roles for Legal Workers and Clients (Users).
- **Legal Worker Module**: Legal Workers can register with detailed profiles, including their role, specialization, location, and contact details.
- **User Module**: Clients can register, view, and filter legal workers by specialization, location, and role.
- **Email Notifications**: Automated email notifications sent to Legal Workers when a Client sends a request for their services.
- **Search and Filterable Marketplace**: Clients can search and filter legal workers by role, location, and specialization.
- **Request System**: Clients can send service requests to Legal Workers, which are emailed directly to the worker.
